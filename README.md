# FoodMood
The rise of the food industry over the last decade in India has resulted in a huge number of investors. This has increased the intensity of competition amongst the various     companies/start-ups. Food culture analysis has thus gained its importance over the last couple of years. Entrepreneurs and investors are willing to invest enormous amounts of   money today. They need to consider a lot of aspects that would help make their business a success.

**FoodMood** is a project that aims at analysing the food culture of a locality by finding the importance of features that determine the success of a restaurant in that area,    and by identifying the correlation between the features etc. Major aspects include:
    <ul>
      <li> Location-wise feature importance (Using Decision Trees) </li>
      <li> Recommendation of the best options for the important features (Using a Combinatorial Approach) </li>
      <li> Prediction of Ideal Pricing Range for a restaurant (Using Logistic Regression and an Artificial Neural Network) </li>
      <li> Sentiment Analysis of Reviews </li>
    </ul>
    
With our analysis, we aim at helping upcoming entrepreneurs take the right decisions for the best growth of their food chain business.
